# convolution-to-image
Program that uses 4 different methods to apply convolution on an image using a gaussian kernel.

### First method
First method is by applying manual convolution, multiplying the kernel with the image. 

### Second method
Using the conv2() function

### Third method
Using the imfilter() function

### Fourth method
* Padding the image & kernel. 
* Converting to Frequency domain.*
* Multiplying the 2 images.
* Convert the images to space / time domain
* Extract the inner array
